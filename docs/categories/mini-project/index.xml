      <description>Since March 2018, I have worked part-time as a Pro-Bono Fundraising Data Analyst for the nonprofit organization New York Encounter. I performed several ETL tasks –via SQL-based data transformations and R programming– to set up the integration of data that existed in separate and disconnected platforms. Namely, the Nonprofit had informations on donors and attendees on SendGrid, donations recorded via Square and miscellaneous other information in Salesforce. After cleaning and merging such information, I performed an initial explorative characterization of the Nonprofit private donors.</description>

      <description> This mini-study project was a take-home test I completed in winter 2018 as part of a job interview for a consultancy with IFC (in collaboration with LinkedIn). I used it as an opportunity to refresh some R programming and learn to use the xaringan package to make html presentations.

      <description>This mini-study project was an exercise to learn how to use the World Bank’s API for the World Development Indicator (WDI) repository.
In this study, I explore the indicator Life expectancy at birth and I also do some comparative analisys using other indicators that I expect to be highly correlated with life expectancy: namely GDP and the status of Fragile and conflict affected situations (FCS).
 In order to flag the individual countries that are classified as FCS, I used the World Bank list of economies (as of June 2017) found here</description>
