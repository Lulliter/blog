      <description> Immigration  ‚ÄúAiutiamoli a casa loro‚Äù - many think that ODA would be the step to keep people in Africa, whereas observation of incoming economic migrants shows that those travelling are not the most destitute, but the slightly better off. Hence - in the short term - aid is likely to make more people better off so much so to become candidates for leaving (Source: ISPI podcast)   Climate change  Mckinsey Report   </description>

      <description>Since March 2018, I have worked part-time as a Pro-Bono Fundraising Data Analyst for the nonprofit organization New York Encounter. I performed several ETL tasks ‚Äìvia SQL-based data transformations and R programming‚Äì to set up the integration of data that existed in separate and disconnected platforms. Namely, the Nonprofit had informations on donors and attendees on SendGrid, donations recorded via Square and miscellaneous other information in Salesforce. After cleaning and merging such information, I performed an initial explorative characterization of the Nonprofit private donors.</description>

      <description> This mini-study project was a take-home test I completed in winter 2018 as part of a job interview for a consultancy with IFC (in collaboration with LinkedIn). I used it as an opportunity to refresh some R programming and learn to use the xaringan package to make html presentations.

      <description>This mini-study project was an exercise to learn how to use the World Bank‚Äôs API for the World Development Indicator (WDI) repository.
In this study, I explore the indicator Life expectancy at birth and I also do some comparative analisys using other indicators that I expect to be highly correlated with life expectancy: namely GDP and the status of Fragile and conflict affected situations (FCS).
 In order to flag the individual countries that are classified as FCS, I used the World Bank list of economies (as of June 2017) found here</description>

      <description>Community Mapping For Flood Resilience ‚ÄúDar Ramani Huria‚Äù (Swahili for ‚ÄúDar Open Map‚Äù) is the name of a community-based mapping project in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. This project brought together international agencies, local university students and community members with the aim of putting the city‚Äôs most flood- prone areas ‚Äúon the map‚Äù for the first time, an endeavor made possible by the coordinated adoption of a host of geospatial and open data tools.</description>

      <description>I prepared this blog post as a reflection on the experience as a graduate student and summer intern in a NGO working in Brazil
 Uno dei temi che hanno maggiormente animato il recente dibattito sulla cooperazione allo sviluppo √® la critica rivolta a governi e istituzioni multilaterali (Banca Mondiale, Fondo Monetario Internazionale e varie agenzie ONU in primis), di gestire gli aiuti ai paesi in via di sviluppo in modo arbitrario, assitenzialista e ultimamente inefficace (in sintesi con un approccio top-down).</description>
