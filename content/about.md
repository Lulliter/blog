This blog is intended as a place to collect notes-to-self, R code snippets, inspiring ideas, and side-projects that stay tenaciously planted on my "To-Do" list.

My name is **Luisa M. Mimmi**. I was born and raised in :it:, although I have been in the :us: for the last 10+ years, based in Washington, DC. 

When I am not procrastinating, or chasing a decent espresso, I am a consultant for multi-lateral development banks, passionate about using data to understand and tackle various dimensions of infrastructure poverty. 

For more details about my 'official' job see links to other platforms or [CV](https://lulliter.github.io/blog/cv/))
