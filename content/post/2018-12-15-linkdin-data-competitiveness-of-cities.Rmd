## Study of jobs and competitivity of cities

This mini-study project was a take-home test I completed in winter 2018 as part of a job interview for a consultancy with **IFC** (in collaboration with **LinkedIn**). I used it as an opportunity to refresh some R programming and learn to use the `xaringan` package to make html presentations.
