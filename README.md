### My personal website (blog/portfolio)

https://luisamimmi.com/

#### Repo and original file  

- Originally built as Project Github Page
	
	{config.toml""} `baseURL = "https://lulliter.github.io/blog/"`   <!-- https://[USERNAME].github.io/[REPO_NAME] -->  
	
	{config.toml""} `relativeURLs = true`
	
	{config.toml""} `publishDir = "docs"`  <!-- By default would be /public We need it to be the /docs (Github docs branch) -->

- then I bought a domain on Google Domain (@ gmail) on Sept 29/2019 and redirected to: 
	
	{config.toml""} `baseURL = "https://luisamimmi.com/"`
